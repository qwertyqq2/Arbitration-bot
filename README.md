# Arbitration-bot

This is an attempt to analyze arbitrage through a conventional exchange and the liquidity market.

The Binance exchange was used as an example.

I used a binance trial account:

apikey="T9zIfoHSIsA9KhRIok1uzIcO4MKrRfSKdGQEtVoU5CkkuhIppdvb9tqLCofWL03G"
secretkey="22zkt5SByc4twvpsPCWsmta5EPNJW1f0ip0ivruQdi47ecuVDWKeth59pLBZLixZ"
